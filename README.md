# Texture-Classification-Mathematica
Multi-feature image texture classifier. Benchmark for comparing statistical features and geometrical features. 


Classifier_name.mx files provide the saved models trained on features extracted on the basis of a given approach. Statistical features provide a much better result.

Using GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurence matrix) doesn't improve the performance of the statistical based model by a considerable margin.
